# jgt-mixed-dynamics
Mixed dynamics code from our paper [Real-Time Animation Using a Mix of Physical Simulation and Kinematics](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/2151237X.2009.10129288), Journal of Graphics, GPU, & Game Tools, 14(4):1-21, ISSN 1086-7651, 2009.

Contains the Featherstone recursive newton euler inverse dynamics solver (hmi.physics.inversedynamics.RNEASolver), 
our math library (hmi.math, includes spatial algebra classes and numerical differentiation) and our implementation of 
Winter's low pass filter (hmi.math.digitalfilter.Winters).
